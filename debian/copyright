  Creative Commons Corporation ("Creative Commons") is not a law firm and
  does not provide legal services or legal advice. Distribution of
  Creative Commons public licenses does not create a lawyer-client or
  other relationship. Creative Commons makes its licenses and related
  information available on an "as-is" basis. Creative Commons gives no

  .
  Using Creative Commons Public Licenses
  .
  Creative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of terms and
  conditions that creators and other rights holders may use to share
  original works of authorship and other material subject to copyright
  and certain other rights specified in the public license below. The
  following considerations are for informational purposes only, are not
  exhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses.
  .
      Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are
      intended for use by those authorized to give the public
      permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by
      copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are
      irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms
      and conditions of the license they choose before applying it.
      Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before
      applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the
      material as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any
      material not subject to the license. This includes other CC-
      licensed material, or material used under an exception or
      limitation to copyright. More considerations for licensors:
      wiki.creativecommons.org/Considerations_for_licensors
  .
      Considerations for the public: By using one of our public
      licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to use the
      licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If
      the licensor's permission is not necessary for any reason--for
      example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to
      copyright--then that use is not regulated by the license. Our
      licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain
      other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of
      the licensed material may still be restricted for other
      reasons, including because others have copyright or other
      rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests,
      such as asking that all changes be marked or described.
      Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to
      respect those requests where reasonable. More_considerations
      for the public:

  License
  .
  By exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and agree
  to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Creative Commons
  Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International Public License ("Public
  License"). To the extent this Public License may be interpreted as a
  contract, You are granted the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your

      categorized. For purposes of this Public License, the rights
      specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar
      Rights.
  .
   e. Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the
      absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws
      fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright
      Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international
      agreements.
  .

      License.
  .
   i. Licensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the
      terms and conditions of this Public License, which are limited to
      all Copyright and Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the
      Licensed Material and that the Licensor has authority to license.
  .
   j. Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights
      under this Public License.
  .
   k. Share means to provide material to the public by any means or
      process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such
      as reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution,
      dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material
      available to the public including in ways that members of the
      public may access the material from a place and at a time
      individually chosen by them.
  .
   l. Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright
      resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of
      the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases,
      as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially
      equivalent rights anywhere in the world.
  .
   m. You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights
      under this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.
  .
  .
  Section 2 -- Scope.
  .
   a. License grant.
  .
        1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License,
           the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,
           non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to
           exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:
  .
             a. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or
                in part; and
  .
             b. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.
  .
        2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where
           Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public
           License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with
           its terms and conditions.
  .
        3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section
           6(a).
  .
        4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The
           Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in
           all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created,
           and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The
           Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or
           authority to forbid You from making technical modifications
           necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including
           technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective
           Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License,
           simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)
           (4) never produces Adapted Material.
  .
        5. Downstream recipients.
  .
             a. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every
                recipient of the Licensed Material automatically
                receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the
                Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this
                Public License.
  .
             b. Additional offer from the Licensor -- Adapted Material.
                Every recipient of Adapted Material from You
                automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to
                exercise the Licensed Rights in the Adapted Material
                under the conditions of the Adapter's License You apply.
  .
             c. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose
                any additional or different terms or conditions on, or
                apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the
                Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the
                Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed
                Material.
  .
        6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or
           may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You
           are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected
           with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,
           the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as
           provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).
  .
   b. Other rights.
  .
        1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not
           licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,
           privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to
           the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to
           assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited
           extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed
           Rights, but not otherwise.
  .
        2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this
           Public License.
  .
        3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to
           collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed
           Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society
           under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory
           licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly
           reserves any right to collect such royalties.
  .
  .
  Section 3 -- License Conditions.
  .
  Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the
  following conditions.
  .
   a. Attribution.
  .
        1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified
           form), You must:
  .
             a. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor
                with the Licensed Material:
  .
                  i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed
                     Material and any others designated to receive
                     attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by
                     the Licensor (including by pseudonym if
                     designated);
  .
                 ii. a copyright notice;
  .

           rights granted under the Adapter's License You apply.
  .
  .
  Section 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.
  .
  Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that
  apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:

  Section 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.
  .
   a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE
      EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS
      AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF
      ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS,
      IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
      WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
      PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,
      ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT

      ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
  .
   b. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE
      TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,

      DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR
      IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
  .
   c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided
      above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent
      possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and
      waiver of all liability.

  .
  Section 6 -- Term and Termination.
  .
   a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and

           violation; or
  .
        2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.
  .
      For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any
      right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations
      of this Public License.
  .
   c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the
      Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop

  .
  Section 7 -- Other Terms and Conditions.

  .
   a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and
      shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose
      conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully
      be made without permission under this Public License.
  .
   b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is
      deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the
      minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision
      cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License
      without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and
      conditions.
  .
   c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no
      failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the
      Licensor.
  .
   d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted
      as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities
      that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal
      processes of any jurisdiction or authority.

License: GPL-3+ with AutoConf exception
    Based on the GNU General Public License, which on Debian systems can be
    found in `/usr/share/common-licenses/GPL-3', with the following exception:
    .
    AUTOCONF CONFIGURE SCRIPT EXCEPTION
    .
    Version 3.0, 18 August 2009
    .
    Copyright © 2009 Free Software Foundation, Inc. >http://fsf.org/<
    .
    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license
    document, but changing it is not allowed.
    .
    This Exception is an additional permission under section 7 of the GNU
    General Public License, version 3 ("GPLv3"). It applies to a given file that
    bears a notice placed by the copyright holder of the file stating that the
    file is governed by GPLv3 along with this Exception.
    .
    The purpose of this Exception is to allow distribution of Autoconf's typical
    output under terms of the recipient's choice (including proprietary).
    .
    0. Definitions.
    "Covered Code" is the source or object code of a version of Autoconf that is
    a covered work under this License.
    .
    "Normally Copied Code" for a version of Autoconf means all parts of its
    Covered Code which that version can copy from its code (i.e., not from its
    input file) into its minimally verbose, non-debugging and non-tracing
    output.
    .
    "Ineligible Code" is Covered Code that is not Normally Copied Code.
    .
    1. Grant of Additional Permission.
    You have permission to propagate output of Autoconf, even if such
    propagation would otherwise violate the terms of GPLv3. However, if by
    modifying Autoconf you cause any Ineligible Code of the version you
    received to become Normally Copied Code of your modified version, then
    you void this Exception for the resulting covered work. If you convey
    that resulting covered work, you must remove this Exception in accordance
    with the second paragraph of Section 7 of GPLv3.
    .
    2. No Weakening of Autoconf Copyleft.
    The availability of this Exception does not imply any general presumption
    that third-party software is unaffected by the copyleft requirements of the
    license of Autoconf.

License: CPL-1
  THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS COMMON PUBLIC
  LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM
  CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.
  .
  1. DEFINITIONS
  .
  "Contribution" means:
  .
      a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and
  documentation distributed under this Agreement, and
  .
      b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:
  .
      i) changes to the Program, and
  .
      ii) additions to the Program;
  .
      where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are
  distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution 'originates' from a
  Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone
  acting on such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include additions to
  the Program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in
  conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not
  derivative works of the Program.
  .
  "Contributor" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.
  .
  "Licensed Patents " mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are
  necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when
  combined with the Program.
  .
  "Program" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this Agreement.
  .
  "Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement,
  including all Contributors.
  .
  2. GRANT OF RIGHTS
  .
      a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants
  Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to
  reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform,
  distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such
  derivative works, in source code and object code form.
  .
      b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants
  Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under Licensed
  Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the
  Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form.
  This patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the
  Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such
  addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the
  Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations
  which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.
  .
      c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses
  to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any
  Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual
  property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to
  Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of
  intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the
  rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole
  responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any.
  For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to
  distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license
  before distributing the Program.
  .
      d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient
  copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set
  forth in this Agreement.
  .
  3. REQUIREMENTS
  .
  A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under its
  own license agreement, provided that:
  .
      a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and
  .
      b) its license agreement:
  .
      i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and
  conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and
  non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and
  fitness for a particular purpose;
  .
      ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for
  damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential
  damages, such as lost profits;
  .
      iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered
  by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and
  .
      iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such
  Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or
  through a medium customarily used for software exchange.
  .
  When the Program is made available in source code form:
  .
      a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and
  .
      b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.
  .
  Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within the
  Program.
  .
  Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if
  any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the
  originator of the Contribution.
  .
  4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION
  .
  Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with
  respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is
  intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who
  includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner
  which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if
  a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such
  Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify
  every other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses, damages
  and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal
  actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the
  extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in
  connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product
  offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses
  relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order
  to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial
  Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to
  control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any
  related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in
  any such claim at its own expense.
  .
  For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product
  offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that
  Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties
  related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such
  Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the
  Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other
  Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court
  requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial
  Contributor must pay those damages.
  .
  5. NO WARRANTY
  .
  EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN
  "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR
  IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE,
  NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each
  Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and
  distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of
  rights under this Agreement, including but not limited to the risks and costs of
  program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data,
  programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.
  .
  6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY
  .
  EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY
  CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL,
  SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST
  PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT,
  STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY
  OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS
  GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
  .
  7. GENERAL
  .
  If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable
  law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the
  terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such
  provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such
  provision valid and enforceable.
  .
  If Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor with respect to
  a patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a
  lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by that Contributor to such Recipient
  under this Agreement shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. In
  addition, if Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity
  (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program
  itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware)
  infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under
  Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.
  .
  All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to
  comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does
  not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of
  such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate,
  Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as
  reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement
  and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and
  survive.
  .
  Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in
  order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be
  modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to
  publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time.
  No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this Agreement.
  IBM is the initial Agreement Steward. IBM may assign the responsibility to serve
  as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of the
  Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including
  Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement
